## Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association

The Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association (MRAA) is a not-for-profit professional association whose purpose is to promote and encourage the creation of all forms of the visual arts and to foster information sharing through group sponsored workshops, programs, and outstanding art exhibitions.

## Exhibitions
Exhibitions are a major focus of the Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association. All exhibiting members are encouraged to display original artworks at MRAA art shows throughout the Richmond area. In addition, each year members display their latest pieces in an Annual Membersâ€™ Show, judged by a prominent local artist.

## Purpose
The purpose of the MRAA Tech organization is to provide online web solutions to assist MRAA members with participating in exhibitions. It also seeks to provide the MRAA board with tools to communicate with members, manage collecting dues and exhibition fees, and helping artists seeking to become members with an online application.
